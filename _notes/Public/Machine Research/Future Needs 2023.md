## Software Needs
- Consolidated print queue management - the ability for students to understand the availability of 3D printers remotely
- Consolidated print job payment software that doesn’t rely on trusting students to pay for materials

## Hardware Needs
- Composite material printing
- Larger scale printing  

## Data

### 1. Usage Comparison

*JPS Submission Data - Advanced Lab Printer Usage Fall 2022*

Clearly, SLA printing with the Form 3 has been a hit this past semester. This has been this way since those printers were adopted. Adding two new Form 3 printers has helped meet the demand. As it is now, I don’t think there is an immediate need for more than four. 

### 2. Material Costs of Current Materials
