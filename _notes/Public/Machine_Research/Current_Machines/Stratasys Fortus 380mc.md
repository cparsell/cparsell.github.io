#### Description
The Fortus can print a handful of different filament plastics (ABS, polycarbonate, PC-ABS blend, etc.). It is accurate and reliable and is the largest print volume we have (12 x 14 x 12 inches). It does have its kinks but is still operational and I hope it gives us a few more years. It’s generally a hardy machine.
