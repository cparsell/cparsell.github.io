> Airborne powder concentrations associated with normal use of the Fuse ecosystem are typically significantly below recommended and permissible exposure limits. For example, studies performed at Formlabs SLS R&D facilities, have shown that airborne powder concentrations associated with normal use of the Fuse ecosystem, even with more than a dozen printers in one room, are below 2% of the OSHA permissible exposure limit for the total particulate matter and respirable particulate matter and below 15% of the OSHA permissible exposure limit for carbon black. The normal use of the Fuse ecosystem complies with OSHA dust exposure regulations.
