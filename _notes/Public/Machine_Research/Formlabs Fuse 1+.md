#### Specs
Technology:: **Selective Laser sintering (SLS)**
Material_Type:: Elastomers, thermoplastics
Material_Format:: powder
Material_Names:: Nylon 11, Nylon 12, and Nylon 12 GF
Material_Cost:: approx. $1/kg
Build_Volume:: 6.49 × 6.49 × 11.8 in** (165 × 165 × 300 mmm)
Resolution:: 0.004 in (110 microns)

Pros: 
- Higher performance laser allowing for sintering Nylon 11 CF (Fuse 1 does not)
- Low cost SLS machine, ease of use
- Low waste but not zero waste
Cons: 
- Powdered materials are a health hazard
- Requires [Fuse Sift](https://formlabs.com/post-processing/fuse-sift/) to post-process

#### Description
SLS 3D printing fuses powder layer by layer. The unused material supports the parts during printing so you can create complex, interconnecting designs with no need for support structures. It requires the [Fuse Sift](https://formlabs.com/post-processing/fuse-sift/) for part extraction and powder recovery. Materials cost roughly $1/kg

PPE required: 
- Eye protection
- impermeable gloves
- a mask (if ventilation is insufficient)

> Airborne powder concentrations associated with normal use of the Fuse ecosystem are typically significantly below recommended and permissible exposure limits. For example, studies performed at Formlabs SLS R&D facilities, have shown that airborne powder concentrations associated with normal use of the Fuse ecosystem, even with more than a dozen printers in one room, are below 2% of the OSHA permissible exposure limit for the total particulate matter and respirable particulate matter and below 15% of the OSHA permissible exposure limit for carbon black. The normal use of the Fuse ecosystem complies with OSHA dust exposure regulations.
