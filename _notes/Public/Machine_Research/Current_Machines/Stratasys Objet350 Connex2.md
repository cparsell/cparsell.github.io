### Description 
The smaller Objet260 was purchased when Jacobs opened. The 350 was donated some years later - it was older than the 260 but had very few miles on it. These printers served researchers involved with microfluidics for some years. The Pandemic interrupted that usage as it did everything else and, when we returned, the microfluidics researchers had not returned. I have not heard if they have machines of their own that they rely on or if research has moved on to other techniques.

These printers are very powerful for visualizing design concepts - some materials are more representational, only a few are functionally strong. All of the materials are expensive - these resins have always been the most expensive materials in the Advanced Lab. The resins cost students **$7.92 - $8.58 per cubic inch**, depending on which resin. The support material costs about **$3.30 per cubic inch**. The Form 3 materials have become the cheaper alternative. While the Form 3 printers only print one material at a time, they serve a majority of students’ needs at a fraction of the cost.
