*JPS Submission Data - Advanced Lab Printer Usage Fall 2022*

Clearly, SLA printing with the Form 3 has been a hit this past semester. This has been this way since those printers were adopted. Adding two new Form 3 printers has helped meet the demand. As it is now, I don’t think there is an immediate need for more than four. 

### 2. Material Costs of Current Materials <a name="Costs" />
